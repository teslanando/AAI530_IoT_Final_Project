# Power Usage and Temperature Prediction Model
University of San Diego | IoT Final Project | Team 7

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict future temperature based on a dataset of various weather-related features. It involves a correlation analysis to identify features highly related to temperature, data preprocessing, feature selection, model training using linear regression, and model evaluation.

## Features
- Correlation analysis to select relevant features
- Feature engineering to shift temperature values for future prediction
- Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets based on time series
- Training a Linear Regression model
- Evaluating the model with Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- Saving the model for future use
- Extracting feature importance from the model

## Installation
To run this project, you will need Python and the following Python libraries installed:
- NumPy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- joblib

## Usage
To use this project, follow these steps:
    Clone the repository.
    Place your dataset in the root directory or update the dataset path in the script.
    Run the script to train the model and evaluate its performance.
